                        How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
In this project, the user needs were determined through in-person interviews before the start of the project and then by gathering user feedback during development. User requirements could also have been determined to design analysis as well as user testing. 
Once the user requirments were determined user stories were created to incrementally implement the new functions, putting priority on the features that would give the most impact.

                        How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs through collaboration with stake holders to determine system and user requirements. Then creating user stories to increment in sprints, putting priority on stories with the greatest return. I really enjoyed learning the agile development 
methodologies and I hope to incorporate a majority into my development work. The principles I consider most important are the daily scrums to collaborate, stay in communication, and to stay on track. The other principle I would like to continue to incorporate is building 
software in increments and testing in parallel. 

                        What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development utilizes clear and transparent communication between other team members, and they embrace a continuous improvement to themselves and the team. I believe a good team member will take ownership in their work, respect their teammates, 
and follow through on their obligations.
